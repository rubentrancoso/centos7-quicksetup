# centos7-quicksetup

A personal collection of useful script to build my machine after a fresh install to make my life easier.

With those scripts you will just need to run each one you want and everything will be set. No need to download anything, move files or give permission on folders. Everything should be there.

To my machine I gave sudo permission without password to my user.

Enjoy if you like it.
